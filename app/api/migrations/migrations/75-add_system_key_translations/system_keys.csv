labelMatchDesc,"It has a current value and a text selection matching with the modelsuggested value and selection. It will be used as a training sample."
labelMismatchDesc, "It has a current value and text selection but they do not match the model prediction. Accepting the suggestion will replace the current value and text selection with the suggested ones becoming a "match / labeled". If the labeled data is correct and the suggestion is wrong no action is needed. It will be used as a training sample."
labelEmptyDesc,"Accepting is not available since there is no suggestion.If the value is correct and the suggestion is wrong no action is needed. It will be used as a training sample."
valueMatchDesc,"It has a current value that matches the suggestion, but it doesn't have a text selection. Accepting will keep the value as it is and enrich it with the suggested text selection becoming a "match / label" that can be used as a training sample."
valueMismatchDesc, "Accepting the suggestion will replace the current value and text selection with the suggested ones becoming a "match / label" that will be used as a training sample. If the current value is correct, you can still click to fill the text selection so it becomes a "mismatch / label" that will be used as a training sample."
valueEmptyDesc,"Accepting is not available since there is no suggestion. If the value is correct, you can still click to fill the text selection so it becomes a "mismatch / label" that will be used as a training sample."
obsoleteDesc,"A new model is training and processing suggestions. This suggestion was created by a previous model so no actions are possible until the new suggestion is received."
emptyDesc,"Both the current value and the suggestion are empty. You can click to fill the value and text selection so it becomes a "empty / label" that will be used as a training sample."
